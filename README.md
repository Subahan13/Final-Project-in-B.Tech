This is the short description of the project.

Agriculture plays a dominant role in the growth of the countryâ€™s economy. Climate and other environmental changes have become major threats in the agricultural field. Machine learning (ML) is an essential approach for achieving practical and effective solutions to this problem. Crop Yield Prediction involves predicting the yield of crops using historical data such as weather parameters, soil parameters, and historical crop yields. This project focuses on predicting crop yield based on existing data using the Random Forest algorithm. The prediction helps farmers forecast the yield of crops before cultivation. To predict future crop yields accurately, Random Forest, a powerful and popular supervised machine learning algorithm, is used.
